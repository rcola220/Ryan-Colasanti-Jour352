                2023 MLB rule changes: Pitch clock, end of shift and more

            <br><br>
            <p>Change has come to the major leagues! We've had a full month of spring training games to see how the new rules that Major League Baseball's competition committee voted to implement last September have played out. Now, it's time to see those rules in action when it counts.</p>

            <p>All of these rules have been in place in the minor leagues over the previous seasons, leading to wide-ranging changes in pace of play and on-field action. They include a first-ever pitch clock, the elimination of the shift, bigger bases and a limit to how many times a pitcher can disengage from the rubber.</p>

            <p>Here's everything you need to know about the new rules, what they'll mean for the players and how the game is likely to change.</p>

            <!--The Shift Begins-->

            <div class="chapter">
                The shift
            </div>


            <p><span class="subhead">The new rule:</span> At the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders are required to be on the infield dirt (or infield grass) with two on each side of second base. Players will be able to move as soon as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. Originally, infielders who began the game on one side of the field would not be allowed to switch to the other side for the entirety of the game, but that was revised to just each inning -- unless there's a mid-inning substitution.</p>

            <p>In other words, a player who starts an inning at first or second base has to remain on that side of the field for the whole inning but can switch to short or third base the next inning. If there's an injury mid-inning, then the infield can be reset.</p>

            <p><span class="subhead">How it will be enforced:</span> If the hitting team reaches base and runners advance on a ball hit under the violation, the game proceeds without penalties. If the play has any other consequence -- an out, a sacrifice, etc. -- the hitting team can decide either to accept the penalty -- which would add one ball to the hitter's count -- or decline it, and the play would stand.</p>

            <p><span class="subhead">What they're trying to change:</span> The leaguewide batting average was down to .243 in 2022, the lowest since 1968. A lack of singles in particular is at the heart of the decline, with 2022's rate of 5.33 per team the third lowest in MLB history -- and the 2021 and 2020 seasons filling the two spots ahead of it on the all-time list.</p>

            <p><span class="subhead">What it's meant in the minors:</span> During the first two months of the 2022 minor league season, in the lower levels of the minors where shifts are regulated, the batting average on balls in play by left-handed hitters rose by eight points. At Triple-A -- where shifts are not banned -- it was up only three points.</p>

            <p><span class="subhead">What players are saying:</span> It would be hard to find a hitter -- especially a left-handed one -- who isn't on board with eliminating the shift.</p>

            <p>"Growing up, we never had that," Dodgers outfielder Joey Gallo said last season. "It's tough to adjust to it because it wasn't a thing in the minors. ... Over time, it's gotten more extreme and more effective. From a hitter's standpoint, it's something that could be changed."</p>

            <!--End of Gallo image and caption-->

            <p>Perhaps surprisingly, some pitchers are onboard with the move, as well.</p>

            <p>"My biggest complaint about the shift is, how do you explain that to kids?" Phillies reliever David Robertson said. "What's the point of having a shortstop if he can't play shortstop?"</p>
